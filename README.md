# Hangman

[My Notes](notes.md)

A multiplayer experience based on the classic game "hangman," where one player provides the word to be guessed and the other player guesses. Players are awarded points for their performance and must log in so that their points are saved.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to play a game of hangman with a friend but found yourself lacking a piece of paper or a whiteboard on which to play? Has your game of hangman ever been interrupted, leaving you with a perpetual sense of dissatisfaction  at a game never completed? If either of these situations describes you, or if you just really like playing hangman, then we have the perfect website for you. My hangman website allows you to play the classic game in real-time with a friend! Unlike other hangman websites, where you play against a computer with a limited selection of words to guess, our website allows for infinite replayability, where you get both the satisfaction of giving great guesses as well as the jubilant glee of giving your friend a nearly impossible word to guess.  

### Design

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how the players would interact with the backend during the game.

    Word-giver->>Server: Word: "Tree"
    Server -->>Guesser: Word: ----
    Guesser->>Server: Guess: "t"
    Server -->>Word-giver: Word: t---
    Server -->>Guesser: Word: t---
    Server -->>Guesser: Guesser's Score: +50
    Server -->>Word-giver: Guesser's Score +50
```

### Key features

- The user can securely login
- The user can join a game with another user 
- The user can modify the game settings
- The user can play as either the guesser or the word-giver
- The user's points and name are displayed
- All the functionality of the hangman game

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will be used to structure both the login page and the game page.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to style both pages, focusing on intuitive design over stylish graphics. The game itself will have very simple animations and transitions.
- **React** - Buttons and their associated logic for logging in. Text fields and their associated logic for providing a word and giving guesses. Handles updating what the viewer sees as the game progresses and more guesses are made.
- **Service** - Authentication and authorization, a dictionary to check words, retrieving and submitting guesses.
- **DB/Login** - Usernames and passwords will be stored. Along with high scores associated with those users.
- **WebSocket** - When two users join a game, both are notified. As one player guesses, the other player sees the guesses as well. Scores are updated for both players.
